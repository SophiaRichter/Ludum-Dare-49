Herbert1:Well, hello there, John.

Herbert2:Let me guess why you're here. 
You want to apologize for your unfriendly friend?

Herbert3:Well, I'm not mad, I'm just really disappointed.

Herbert4:You don't need to say anything. 
Maybe it's too childish to be this angry about someone taking his hat.

Herbert5:Maybe I should be happy that he likes my hat and wanted to try it on?

Herbert6:You know, fashion isn't what it has been.
Where are all the hats and fine clothes?

Herbert7:I'm sorry boy, I'm just talking and talking.
Here, let me open this door for you.
And tell Rob that I'm sorry.

Herbert8:Nice that you want to keep this old guy company, but go ahead and do what you must.
