John1:O-oh. Hello, mister. 
I'm just standing here and doing the science.

John2:Yep, juuuust thinking and sciencing!

John3:You're a persistent one, huh? 
Or maybe more clever than your colleagues.
Alright, listen. I lost a little something.
Doesn't matter what it is. I just... lost it.

John4:Wastepaper, if you know what I'm talking about. 
If you want to help me, just help me find it.
I'm happy to open this door for you afterwards.

John5:No, that's not it...

John6:Oh, you found it! You... didn't happen to read it, did you?
Ah, nevermind, my friend, you helped me and so I'll help you.

John7:Go on, the door is opened now.
