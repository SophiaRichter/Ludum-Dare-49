Rob1:Yeah? What do you need?

Rob2:We won't get anywhere if you military guys keep bugging us.

Rob3:Come on, we have things to do!

Rob4:Well, I know it might seem that I'm just standing here and doing nothing, but...
I need to get into the next room, but my colleague and I had an argument and...
Let's just say the door is firmly closed.

Rob5:I mean... if you could use your muscles and open this door...
No, wait, my boss is going to kill me if I let you kick the door in.
Or maybe your boss kills us both. Seems more plausible, if you ask me.

Rob6:What would Doge do?
