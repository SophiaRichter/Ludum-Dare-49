Herbert1:These inconsidered youngsters!
You look away for one moment and they make fun of you!

Herbert2:And who are you again?

Herbert3: I don't care if you are mad that you can't pass the door.
I'm trying to prove a point here!

Herbert4: No matter how long you stand here, I'm not opening this door.
