Herbert-John1:Well, hello there, John.

Herbert-John2:Let me guess why you're here. You want to apologize for your unfriendly friend?

Herbert-John3:Well, I'm not mad, I'm just really disappointed.

Herbert-John4:You don't need to say anything.  Maybe it's too childish to be this angry about someone taking his hat.

Herbert-John5:Maybe I should be happy that he likes my hat and wanted to try it on?

Herbert-John6:You know, fashion isn't what it has been. Where are all the hats and fine clothes?

Herbert-John7:I'm sorry boy, I'm just talking and talking. Here, let me open this door for you. And tell Rob that I'm sorry.

Herbert-John8:Nice that you want to keep this old guy company, but go ahead and do what you must.

Herbert-Rob1:YOU? How dare you to come through this door?!

Herbert-Rob2:What do you want? I'm not gonna open this door for you.

Herbert-Rob3:Even if you're standing here for all time, I'm not opening the door!

Herbert-Rob4:Not even a little bit, you just don't deserve it!

Herbert-Rob5:So, you just want to stare at me and be silent? I can play this game too!

Herbert-Rob6:... 

Herbert-Soldier1:These inconsidered youngsters! You look away for one moment and they make fun of you!

Herbert-Soldier2:And who are you again? Judging by the green clothes a soldier, I suppose?

Herbert-Soldier3: I don't care if you are mad that you can't pass the door. I'm trying to prove a point here!

Herbert-Soldier4: No matter how long you stand here, I'm not opening this door.

John-Soldier1:O-oh. Hello, mister. I'm just standing here and doing the science.

John-Soldier2:Yep, juuuust thinking and sciencing!

John-Soldier3:You're a persistent one, huh? Or maybe more clever than your colleagues. Alright, listen. I lost a little something. Doesn't matter what it is. I just... lost it.

John-Soldier4:Wastepaper, if you know what I'm talking about. If you want to help me, just help me find it. I'm happy to open this door for you afterwards.

John-Soldier5:No, that's not it...

John-Soldier6:Oh, you found it! You... didn't happen to read it, did you? Ah, nevermind, my friend, you helped me and so I'll help you.

John-Soldier7:Go on, the door is opened now.

Rob-Herbert1:Huh, what are you doing here, Herbert?

Rob-Herbert2:You're not mad at me for opening the door, are you?

Rob-Herbert3:Don't treat me with silence, I already told you I'm sorry.

Rob-Herbert4:Alright then, I'm just going to work as if you wouldn't stand here... creepily.

Rob-Herbert5:...

Rob-John1:Oh, hey John! How's it going up there?

Rob-John2:Listen, I don't want to bug you about this, but... Herbert is mad at me and refuses to open the doors in this part of the lab.

Rob-John3:All I did was fetching his hat and putting it on my head. I didn't know that this was a crime in his eyes!

Rob-John4:Maybe he thought I wanted to mock him? Might be...

Rob-John5:However, we're not going anywhere if these doors are locked.

Rob-John6:I heard the janitor left his toolbox somewhere, maybe we can find it?

Rob-John7:Oh, you already have it! I knew I could count on you! Give me a second, I'm going to open this door. I can't help with the door on the other side though. Herbert is going to kill me if I unlock it with the toolbox.

Rob-John8:Go ahead buddy, the door is open now! The beer this evening is on me.

Rob-Soldier1:Yeah? What do you need?

Rob-Soldier2:We won't get anywhere if you military guys keep bugging us.

Rob-Soldier3:Come on, we have things to do!

Rob-Soldier4:Well, I know it might seem that I'm just standing here and doing nothing, but... I need to get into the next room, but my colleague and I had an argument and... Let's just say the door is firmly closed.

Rob-Soldier5:I mean... if you could use your muscles and open this door... No, wait, my boss is going to kill me if I let you kick the door in. Or maybe your boss kills us both. Seems more plausible, if you ask me.

Rob-Soldier6:What would Doge do?

Soldier-Anyone1:Waddaya want?!

Soldier-Anyone2:Hmmm?

Soldier-Anyone3:What's wrong with you?

Soldier-Anyone4:Keep working, bud.

Soldier-Anyone5:What?

Soldier-Anyone6:Nothing to do?

Soldier-Anyone7:Well, I'm also bored. I want to shoot something!

Soldier-Anyone8:We are going to stay as long as you stand around and do nothing.

Soldier-Anyone9:Got any zigarettes? 

Soldier-Anyone10:What a nerd.

Soldier-Anyone11:Huh?

Soldier-Anyone12:Man, I gotta pee!

Soldier-Anyone13:Hope I'll be home for the game.

Soldier-Anyone14:Okay, let me be clear: DON'T. JUST. STAND. AROUND.

Soldier-Anyone15:Some people...

Soldier-Anyone16:Is this how you do science?

Soldier-Anyone17:Alright, fine. If you want to start a staring contest, I'm not gonna lose!

Soldier-Anyone18:...
