Rob1:Oh, hey John! How's it going up there?

Rob2:Listen, I don't want to bug you about this, but...
Herbert is mad at me and refuses to open the doors in this part of the lab.

Rob3:All I did was fetching his hat and putting it on my head.
I didn't know that this was a crime in his eyes!

Rob4:Maybe he thought I wanted to mock him? 
Might be...

Rob5:However, we're not going anywhere if these doors are locked.

Rob6:I heard the janitor left his toolbox somewhere, maybe we can find it?

Rob7:Oh, you already have it! I knew I could count on you!
Give me a second, I'm going to open this door. 
I can't help with the door on the other side though. 
Herbert is going to kill me if I unlock it with the toolbox.

Rob8:Go ahead buddy, the door is open now!
The beer this evening is on me.
